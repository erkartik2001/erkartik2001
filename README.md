# Hi! 👋 I'm Kartik Baderiya

🚀 AI Engineer | LLM Specialist | Generative AI Enthusiast

Skilled and Project-Oriented AI/ML Engineer passionate about solving real-world problems using Machine Learning, LLMs, and Generative AI. I build intelligent systems that bridge **human potential and machine intelligence**. From **large language models (LLMs)** to **robotics** to **vision-powered agents**, I love creating AI systems that actually work — and scale. I have hands-on experience building intelligent systems from scratch, fine-tuning large models, and developing end-to-end AI pipelines.
